# Unit 17 NoSQL Homework: Workout Tracker

This project was to create a back-end connection for a web-based workout tracker using provided front-end code with a Mongo database, a Mongoose schema and Express to handle the routing.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Business Context

A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.

## Acceptance Criteria

When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

The user should be able to:

  * Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

  * View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.


## Tech Stack
* Node JS - Chart JS, Express
* Mongo Database
* Mongoose

## Next Steps
Opportunities for additional development:
* Create a "favorite" workout and make this a quick selection.
* Connect to wearable trackers such as FitBit and Apple Watch.
* Allow the app to connect to social media.
* Improve the accessibility of the navigation.
* Allow the user to select preferred colors.
